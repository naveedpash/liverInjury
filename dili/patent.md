# Introduction

Drug induced liver injury (DILI) is a clinical entity that is the
leading cause of drug withdrawal from the market and discontinuation of
clinical drug development plans, and remains the most common cause of
acute liver failure (ALF) in the west (1). Conventionally, it has been
classified into intrinsic and idiosyncratic forms. The former is usually
predictable, dose-dependent, and reproducible in pre-clinical
experimental models, while the latter is largely unpredictable, falling
short of any known pharmacological characteristic of the drug in
question, and mostly cannot be explained by animal toxicology studies
(2).

In stark contrast to intrinsic DILI, the diagnosis of idiosyncratic DILI
remains fraught with uncertainty and is the most problematic. Risk factors that
may predispose to developing DILI include an older age, female gender,
concurrent drugs, co-morbidity and genetics (2). Clinical presentation and
course are indistinguishable from other common hepatic disorders, and
pre-existing liver diseases, comorbid conditions and polypharmacy can be potent
confounders. In the United States, some of the most frequently encountered
drugs causing idiosyncratic DILI include antimicrobials
(amoxicillin-clavulanate, nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,
ciprofloxacin, isoniazid), newer agents of anti-neoplastic therapy (such as
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors), and drugs to
treat autoimmune disorders (TNF alpha inhibitors) (4). 

Symptomatology may be variable, from subclinical disease with elevated liver
function tests, to cholestasis, acute fulminant hepatitis, or sinusoidal
obstruction syndrome (3), and thorough investigative workup may be required to
exclude other potential causes such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis
etc. Therefore, DILI remains a diagnosis of exclusion, depending on liver
function tests (aminotransferases ALT and AST, bilirubin levels and alkaline
phosphatase) and causality scores (for instance, the Roussel-Uclaf Causality
Assessment Method score) to detect and classify liver damage (5). The following
thresholds for a diagnosis of DILI were suggested by an international expert
working group and are in use: ALT value ≥5× upper limit of normal, ALP value
≥2× upper limit of normal or ALT value ≥3× upper limit of normal and TB ≥2×
upper limit of normal (6). New biomarkers that can indicate immune activation
accompanying the rise in liver function tests secondary to DILI, will likely
soon constitute the clinical application of precision medicine in this area (7,
8).

Since causality of the drug in question can be difficult to ascertain in cases
of idiosyncratic DILI, considerable emphasis has been placed on building large
national registries to track them. The first DILI registry was set up in Spain,
in 1994 (9); the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) in the US came into
action in 2004, and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began the
process of prospectively analyzing data from twelve different sites in the
country (4). Other registries have been formed in countries and across
continents, providing means for effective collaboration amongst healthcare
practitioners dealing with DILI, and corroboration of data; these include
China, India, Korea and Europe (9). This practice is crucial to understanding
the patterns of drug usage and their correlation with the occurrence of DILI which in turn will afford tailored genomic investigations into novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

# Background

Pakistan does not have a nationwide registry for DILI, effectively
hindering any data analysis to provide numbers on incidence and
prevalence of DILI in a country with an abundance of viral hepatitis,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and fatty liver disease, among other liver
diseases. The aim of this project is to first collect retrospective data
at our tertiary care center, and then partner with other private and
public sector hospitals in the region to centralize this data, with the
ultimate goal of establishing a national DILI network, in full
collaboration with government, pharmaceutical industries and private
healthcare facilities.
